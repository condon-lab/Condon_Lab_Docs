Example Scripts
Want this to be a space for people to put example notebooks and scripts for getting stuff done. I’m not sure exactly what the documentation would look like for this if it would just be a list of things the files or something.
 
Useful External Resources
Links to Research Repos:
I’ll have the students populate this with links to repos from their publications
ParFlow Resources
I’ll fill this in with links and pointers to different
Great Python Packages
Also a list the students will fill in
 
Tutorials and Training Materials:
This will also be just links to resources that we use so can just put a documentation placeholder there.
