# Summary & Updating Instructions
The Group Meetings section contains short descriptions of our past group meetings organized by year and semester.  The group meeting coordinator will keep track of meetings however they wish throughout the semester, keeping in mind that slack deletes messages after 90 days. 

After the conclusion of each semester, they will update this repo accordingly.  Each year we will create a new markdown file.  For formatting the new year, feel free to use our [Template here](Template.md).  

Since this is a public repo, make sure to change the permissions on any slide links to viewer only before adding to this repository.
