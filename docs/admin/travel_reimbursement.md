# Information Regarding Reimbursement for Travel

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">For Pcard reimbursement see will the section on Pcard use  and procedures </span>**


1. You always need to fill out a travel authorization form before you travel (ideally before you incur any expenses even). You can find this on the HAS website under forms.
    1. Route your travel authorization to [sdotwarren@arizona.edu](mailto:sdotwarrend@arizona.edu) as she is the official approver (please copy Garry [gforger@arizona.edu](mailto:gforger@arizona.edu) on any emails to Sarah about reimbursement). 
    2. Alt. link if HAS forms doesnâ€™t work: [https://www.fso.arizona.edu/forms/t](https://www.fso.arizona.edu/forms/t)  (Travel Auth Form is the second from the bottom)
2. You will need to know what account the travel is being charged to. If you don't know what account you are working on you can email Garry Forger and cc Laura.
3. For any event you are attending you can submit for up to two reimbursements. For something like AGU one good way to do this is to submit once for your plane ticket and registration before you go and once after for hotels food etc (Make sure you save receipts for everything in order to get reimbursed (see note below on food).
4. You can be reimbursed for any expenses associated with your travel to the conference -- airplane tickets, ground transportation, airport parking, hotels and food.
5. You can't be reimbursed for alcohol or expenses associated with any entertainment or outings you do for fun while attending a conference.
6. The goal is for you to be fully reimbursed for your travel expenses so its not a personal expense to you. However, please remember that your travel is supported by the grants and we want to be able to support as many people attending conferences as possible so you should be reasonable with your spending. 
1. This means that students are expected to share a room unless it is not feasible or would put you in a position you would not feel comfortable (you should get permission from me in advance if this is the case).
2. This also means that you should not request the full per diem allotment for food every day. Rather please add up all your food expenses at the end and request the correct number of lunches/dinners/breakfasts to make sure that you are compensated for what you spend but not making a profit. (The alternative is you submit receipts for every meal... I find this to be very challenging though especially when eating with other people and sharing checks so I think the best option is just to keep track of your spending and then request per diem to match)

7.  After you return you will need to submit a reimbursement form to Sara with all your receipts. Again this form is on the HAS website under forms.
