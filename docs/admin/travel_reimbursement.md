# Information Regarding Reimbursement for Travel

## General comments
1. You always need a signed travel authorization form before you submit a travel reimbursement.
2. For any event you are attending you can submit for up to two reimbursements (CHECK THAT WITH CINDY). For something like AGU one good way to do this is to submit once for your plane ticket and registration before you go and once after for hotels food etc (Make sure you save receipts for everything in order to get reimbursed (see note below on food).
4. You can be reimbursed for any expenses associated with your travel to the conference (airplane tickets, ground transportation, airport parking, hotels, and food). For transportation like Uber or Lyfts, we need the detailed receipt that shows how much everything was charged and it includes the map. Remember ANY tips are approved up to 20%, not a penny more.
5. You can't be reimbursed for alcohol or expenses associated with any entertainment or outings you do for fun while attending a conference.
6. The goal is for you to be fully reimbursed for your travel expenses so it is not a personal expense to you. However, please remember that your travel is supported by the grants and we want to be able to support as many people attending conferences as possible so you should be reasonable with your spending. 
1. This means that students are expected to share a room unless it is not feasible or would put you in a position you would not feel comfortable (you should get permission from Laura in advance if this is the case).
2. This also means that you should not request the full per diem allotment for food every day. Rather please add up all your food expenses at the end and request the correct number of lunches/dinners/breakfasts to make sure that you are compensated for what you spend but not making a profit. (The alternative is you submit receipts for every meal... I find this to be very challenging though especially when eating with other people and sharing checks so I think the best option is just to keep track of your spending and then request per diem to match)

4.  After you return you will need to submit a reimbursement form to Cindy Barnett [barnettc@arizona.edu](mailto:barnettc@arizona.edu) with all your receipts.

## Tips
- The form must be downloaded always from [https://financialservices.arizona.edu/form/travel-expense-report](https://financialservices.arizona.edu/form/travel-expense-report)
- The travel authorization on the top right must match the signed travel authorization.
- The form should sum automatically but it almost never works so be prepared to fill and sign it manually. It should calculate if you are using chrome, not Edge.
- It is possible that additional questions will be required about the purpose of the trip. Do not worry...It is just bureaucracy.
- The entire process takes a couple of months, so you can ask Cindy about the status of reimbursement.
