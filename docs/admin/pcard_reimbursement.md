## Information Regarding Using the Pcard:


1. Email Sarah [sdotwarren@arizona.edu](mailto:sdotwarrend@arizona.edu) before the p-card is used, so she can log every purchase and keep an eye out for fraud. 
2. The person using the p-card would then send Sarah their receipt and the HAS P-card form [pcard_authorization_form_1.pdf (arizona.edu)](https://has.arizona.edu/sites/default/files/pcard_authorization_form_1.pdf) right away. Sarah has 10 business days after the p-card purchase hits our account to approve and enter the corresponding account information.
