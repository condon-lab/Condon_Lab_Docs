# Information Regarding Travel Authorization

1. A Travel Authorization is required when a University of Arizona Employee, Student, or Designated Campus Colleague will be on travel status (at least 35 miles outside of their duty post) and travels on behalf of University business, regardless of expenses incurred by the University.
2. The form must be downloaded always from [https://financialservices.arizona.edu/form/travel-authorization-form](https://financialservices.arizona.edu/form/travel-authorization-form) because it has a unique correlative number.
3. You must save the form into your device before filling it out. If you complete the form in your web browser data will be lost.

### Tips

* The UA NETID number can be found at the top right of the uaccess web page.
* The DEPT/ORG code is HWRS/469.
* If you have an RA you are considered an employee. In other cases, you are just a student.
* For the funding source (Account), in the travel detail section, you should ask Garry [gforger@arizona.edu](mailto:gforger@arizona.edu) about your account. Ask every time because your funding source could change.
* International travel requires an additional form. This form can takes weeks to be approved so do not leave it to the last day.
* The approver, in the Travel Authorization and Funding Approval section, is Cindy Barnett [barnettc@arizona.edu](mailto:barnettc@arizona.edu). You can check with Garry because the approver could change.
