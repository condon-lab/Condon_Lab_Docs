## Guidelines for using the PCARD (university credit card): 

Lauraâ€™s lab group has a dedicated Pcard (credit card) as of 2024.  Garry is the keeper of the card, please contact him about using the card for purchasing travel related items, technology and other work related items. 

* The Pcard can be used to purchase airline tickets, pay conference registration fees and at times can be used for hotel expenses. 
* The rules around what the Pcard can be used for changes occasionally, please check with Garry on the allowable expenses for Pcard use.
* If you are incorporating personal travel into travel for a conference or meeting, then the Pcard cannot be used. 
* Many people choose not to use the Pcard for charges, since you will not get the miles or points associated with some personal credit cards.
